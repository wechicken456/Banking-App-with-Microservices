# 🏗️ Event-Driven Banking Microservices - Architecture Overview (Golang + PostgreSQL)

## 📌 Architecture Overview

Banking App written in **Golang** to learn about implementation of microservices. The system uses **gRPC** for inter-service communication, **Redis** for background job queueing, and **PostgreSQL** (self-hosted) for data storage. Everything is containerized via **Docker**, with future expansion to **Kubernetes**.

**Current progress**: 

1. Finished setting up PostgreSQL on **docker**.
2. Implementing the `auth` service.

## 🧩 Microservices

| Service                   | Responsibilities                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **auth-service**          | User signup/login, JWT issuance and validation, password hashing                 |
| **user-service**          | Manages user profiles, user metadata, and links users to their accounts          |
| **account-service**       | Manages account details, balances, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history (ACID guarantees) |
| **transfer-service**      | Orchestrates fund transfers: validates source/target accounts, invokes debit/credit via gRPC, ensures consistency |
| **notification-service**  | Sends asynchronous email alerts (e.g. transfer success/failure) using Redis + Gmail SMTP |
| **api-gateway**           | Entry point for client requests; routes HTTP to internal services, handles rate limiting, auth forwarding |

## 🧱 Architecture Patterns

- **Communication**:  
  - gRPC (internal service-to-service)  
  - HTTP (client-facing via API Gateway)

- **Asynchronous Processing**:  
  - Redis queue for background tasks like email alerts and retries

- **Database**:  
  - PostgreSQL (isolated schema per service)  
  - Accessed via `sqlx` and `sqlc`  
  - Migrations managed with `goose`

- **Transactional Integrity**:  
  - Core services maintain ACID within their DBs  
  - Saga pattern used for distributed operations (e.g., fund transfers)  
  - Outbox pattern ensures eventual message delivery  
  - Idempotency keys prevent duplicate processing

## Testing

### Postgres on Docker and Goose

Each microservice will have its own database, and each of them will run on a different docker container.

To test connections database and verify `goose` migrations:

1. `docker compose up`: to start all the containers.
2. `goose postgres "postgres://{USER}:{PASSWORD}@localhost:5432/{DATABASE_NAME}?sslmode=disable"` where each of the variables can be found in the `.env` file.
3. `docker compose down -v`: stop all containers and remove all volumes.

OR using the `Makefile`:
1. `docker compose up`: to start all the containers.
2. `make goose-up`: apply all up migrations.
3. `make goose-down`: apply all down migrations.
4. `docker compose down -v`: stop all containers and remove all volumes.
